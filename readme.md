Simple FTP Monitor
==================

This is a very simple FTP monitor which supports the usual configuration capabilities to monitor one or more
remote FTP servers and then picking up files from one or more directories.  

You can specify the download type (binary/ascii) and also have file patterns.  Also you can tell it to keep a history of the files which have been downloaded so that only new files are picked up.
